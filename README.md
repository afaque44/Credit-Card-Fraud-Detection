# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
'Credit Card Fraud Prediction', involves developing a model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions based on a set of input features. The goal of this project is to help financial institutions detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, which can save them significant amounts of money and protect their customers.
To accomplish this, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data is in a usable format for machine learning models. I also performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the input features and the target variable (fraudulent or not).
